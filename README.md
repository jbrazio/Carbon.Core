A concept that's becoming reality.
**Carbon** is a platform in the form of a DLL which gets added under your Rust server, in the *HarmonyMods* folder. 

**Follow the development roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/Carbon-Modding/projects/1).**

## Documentation

**For server-owner related or development questions, check [here](https://carbon-modding.gitbook.io/docs).**

## Features
* Extremely lightweight, stripped out of additional, unrelated-to-Rust processes
* Familiar folder and plugin-making structure, with the intention to have the system run almost any kind of Oxide plugin
* Permissions system
* Light Hook system

## Installation

### Flavors
Carbon has three different main flavors.

- 🥇 [Production]: the most stable version,
- 🥈 [Staging]: the preview version, could be unstable,
- 🥉 [Development]: the bleeding edge, where new things are born 🍼.

In general most people is advised to get the latest stable version which is the only one considered to be production ready.

### How to install
1. Download the latest version of Carbon from Carbon's Github [release page][2].
2. Unzip the archive to the root of your Rust Dedicated Server.
3. Restart the server and enjoy 🎉.

⚠️ If you are installing on a 🐧 Linux host you will need to execute the `carbon_prepatch.sh` script manually before restarting your server.

### Folder structure
This is the example of a default Carbon installation, the full folder structure will get created when starting the rust dedicated server for the first time after the installation.

```
.
├── config.json
├── configs
├── data
│   ├── oxide.groups.data
│   └── oxide.users.data
├── lang
├── logs
├── plugins
├── temp
└── tools
    └── NStrip.exe
```

## Compilation

This following instructions were written for 🪟 Windows environments but Carbon can be built on 🐧 Linux hosts as well.
The project has been successfully built using:
  - Visual Studio 2019/2022 (🪟)
  - Visual Studio Code (🪟, 🐧)

### Preparing the buildroot

1. ⬇️ Clone [the project][1] on your machine.
2. 📂 Go to the `Tools\Build\win` folder.
3. 👟 Run `bootstrap.bat` for it to download all Rust-related DLLs.
4. 📒 Open the solution found in `Carbon.Core\Carbon.Core.sln`.
5. 🚀 Develop, build and have fun.

## Exporting

To export your own patches locally, run the `Tools\Build\win\build_debug.bat` script.
This will create a `Releases` folder on project's root with the `.dll` and `.zip` files.
